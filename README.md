## What do you mean by HTML?
> HTML is a programming language used to create websites. HTML can also be called backbone of a website in simple words. <br>
> We create the structures of webpages in HTML most of the times and style it using another language called CSS. <br>
> In simple words, you can understand it like this with an example: Your bones are HTML, your muscles are CSS and yor brain is JavaScript. <br>
> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br>
> The extension for a html file is ".html"
