  <!-- Path of the video meant: C://User/Desktop/Video.mp4 .
The path can be anything including a video from the internet. But remember that it's the best practice to keep the video in the same folder as you kept the HTML file.
This becomes easy! 
Video can be of any format, i.e, mp4, MOV, AVI, WMV, etc.
