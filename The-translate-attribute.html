  <div class="logo" translate="no" > A logo </div>
  
  <!-- The translate attribute with "no" is a secret tip which many people don't know!
 What this does is that: if the page is translate to any other language for e.g. "Hindi", our logo won't translate to that language and will remain "A logo" only!
 This is a trick to be applied when you don't want a set of things to be translated to other languages when done.
