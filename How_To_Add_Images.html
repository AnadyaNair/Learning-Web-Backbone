  <img src="Path of image" alt="This text will be displayed if the image is not visible"></img>

<!-- Path of the image meant: C://User/Desktop/Image.png .
The path can be anything including an image from the internet. But remember that it's the best practice to keep the image in the same folder as you kept the HTML file.
This becomes easy! 
Images can be of any format, i.e, jpg, png, webp, gif, etc.
